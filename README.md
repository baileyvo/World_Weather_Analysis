# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a list of random latitudes and longitudes, which were then matched to the nearest city. The current weather was then pulled for these cities. It was then set up so a user can enter their desired temperature range when deciding a vacation destination. A nearby hotel was also pulled for each city. Then, four cities from the list were set up to create a travel itinerary, including a travel route.

## Resources
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.63.2

## Summary
The cities in the map below were generated for current weather between 75 and 90 degrees F. Since it is winter in the northern hemisphere, most destinations are in the southern hemisphere or near the equator.

Four cities in Australia were selected for a vacation, with a route to travel through them.
